### **Design Choices**üé®

I made a research in [Jenn David Design](https://jenndavid.com/colors-that-influence-food-sales-infographic/ "jenndavid.com") website, where I found that a mix of red, orange and light brown would be a nice look for a web application that present recipes. Then I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a pallete of colors that I already had chosen.

![palette](https://github.com/alychinque/CookBook/blob/master/wireframes/palette.png)

#### Fonts

I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") in order to find appropriate fonts for my web application.
For the titles and subtitles, I have used the font [Redressed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Redressed "Redressed") 
and for the main text I have used [Bodoni Moda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bodoni+Moda "Bodoni Moda") and for the brand I have used [Patua One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patua+One).

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Boootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 

## **Wireframes and Flowcharts**üë®‚Äçüîß

### **Wireframes**
I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 

You can find my wireframes below:

#### Desktop Wireframes
* [Wireframes](wireframes/desktop.pdf)

#### Mobile Wireframes
* [Wireframes](wireframes/mobile.pdf)

### **Flowcharts**

I have decided to make a flowchart to completely understand each step of the process. 
I have used [Draw.io](https://draw.io/) to make this flowchart which you can view below: 

* [Flowchart](wireframes/flowchart.pdf)

### **Database Structure**

I have created an database entities in [Draw.io](https://draw.io/)
* [Database](wireframes/data.png)

I also have used MongoDB to set up the database for this project with the following collections: 

#### **Users:**

Key      | Value
---------|-----------
_id      | ObjectId

category        | String
time            | String
yield           | String
ingredients     | String

## **Testing**

### **Registration**

#### User story: As a user, I would like to be able to register for the website so I can add my recipes

* **Plan**  
I want to create a account to be able to add, read, update and delete recipes.

* **Implementation**  
I created a form where the user can add their name, email, and choose a password. 
I have used the pattern attribute to only allow certain characters for the name, email, and password. 
Correct feedback will be displayed whenever the user doesn't meet the pattern critera. 
Before creating the new account, I will check in the database if the email already exists. 
If so, correct feedback will be displayed to the user so he can choose another username. 
Password will be stored with the help of the password generate hash so it is stored safely.
After the registration was succesfull, the user will be redirected to the My Recipes page to add their first recipe.
In case the user wrongfully clicked on register instead of sign-in, a link to the sign-in page is provided so the user doesn't have to go back. 

I have used a variable (register) to make the difference between the register and sign-in form.
When register is equal to True, I added the span which explains the requested format.
By implementing this, I have managed to merge the register and sign-in form into 1 form which simplifies my code. 


* **Test**  
I have tried to create an account with an already existing email. Correct feedback is displayed.
Whenever I didn't meet the pattern criteria, the correct feedback was displayed, explaining which charachters etc are allowed. 
User acccount is created whenever all criteria was met and user is being redirect to My Recipes.


* **Result**  
Registration form is working as planned and user information is stored safely in the mongodb Users collection.
Feedback provided stands out nicely to inform the user. 
Redirection to blank My Recipe works as well as planned so the user can choose to add its recipe right away. 
Tested the registration on various browers and devices and the form is responsive and userfriendly. 

* **Verdict**
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.


### **Sign In**

#### User story: As a user, I want to login after I created an account and see my previous inserted information.

* **Plan**  
My plan is to create a login form where the user can fill in its email and password.
After signing in, the user will be redirected to the My Recipe page where the user can see the previously inserted recipes.
In case the user doesn't have any Recipe added to its profile, a message will be displayed with "no recipes added" and a link to add first recipe.

* **Implementation**  
I created a form where the user can fill in its email and password which will be verified with the information stored in the database. 
When the wrong information is being filled in, the correct feedback will be provided to the user. 
In case the user wrongfully clicked on sign-in instead of register, a link to the register page is provided so the user doesn't have to go back. 

* **Test**  
Signing in with the correct email and password works as planned and the correct page will be displayed. 
When the user fills in the wrong email and/or password, the same message is being displayed on the screen. 
Also here the feedback message didn't stand out well enough so I have changed the color to red. 
Redirecting to register page and 'back to homepage' link works as well. 

* **Result**  
Sign-in form is working as planned and the input is being verified correctly with the stored information of the database.
Redirection to the correct page works as well as planned so the user can either add a recipe on My Recipes page or view its previously inserted recipes.
Tested the sign-in form on various browers and devices and the form is responsive and userfriendly. 
Feedback provided to the user stands out nicely. 

* **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.


#### User story: As a user, I want a home dashboard page that shows the latest recipes added.

* **Plan**
My plan was create a home page that shows the latest recipes added, even for user that are not subscribe, they can have access to the home page
and they can see the recipes.

* **Implementation** 
I created a panel with the last six recipes added, I used a for reverse to get the recipes backwords.

* **Test** 
As planned every user with credentials or not can have access to the recipes.
 
 * **Result**  
 It works just fine and show the user the last six recipes as planned.
 
 * **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.


#### User story: As a user, I want to be able to search recipes.

* **Plan**
The plan is create a search bar where users can search recipes by nome of the recipe or ingredients.

* **Implementation** 
First I added a search bar to home and recipes pages, then I created indexes to search in mongo db so that user can search by name of the recipe or ingredients.
Then I created two functions in app.py, one for for search in the home page and another to search in the recipes page.

* **Test** 
I have testing the search functionality with empty field, with a wrong word, and with a word in the database and all response was correct.
 
 * **Result** 
 The result was satisfactory it shows the correct output depends on the input.
 
 * **Verdict**
 The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.


#### User story: As a user, I want the web application to be easy to use. 

* **Plan**
The plan is create an application user friendly, where the user can find everything easily. Also an application responsive.

* **Implementation** 
I create a home page with a panel showing the last six recipes. The user can easily find a navbar where they can sign in, sign up or chech the whole page with recipes. 
If the user sign in they can add a recipe and after that edit or delete it easily. also they can logout.

* **Test** 
Every panel loads well and the experience is good and smooth.
 
 * **Result** 
 The result is good, it works well through different devices.
 
 * **Verdict**
 The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.
