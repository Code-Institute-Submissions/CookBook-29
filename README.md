### **Design Choices**

I made a research in [Jenn David Design](https://jenndavid.com/colors-that-influence-food-sales-infographic/ "jenndavid.com") website, where I found that a mix of red, orange and green would be a nice look for a web application that present recipes. Then I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a pallete of colors that I already had chosen.

#### Fonts

I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") in order to find appropriate fonts for my web application.
For the titles and subtitles, I have used the font [Redressed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Redressed "Redressed") 
and for the main text I have used [Bodoni Moda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bodoni+Moda "Bodoni Moda"). 

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Materialize provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
The reason why I choose Materiaize is mainly due to the various features they offer like a datepicker, floating action button etc.
